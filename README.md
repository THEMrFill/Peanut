# Peanut

This is the coding exercise for Peanut, providing a list of news items from an API

Unfortunately I couldn't get the aoo talking to the endpoint from a device or emulator, although in a browser (on PC) it responded correctly

It's written in Kotlin using Coroutines, Koin, Room & Retrofit (which doesn't do anything ATM)
