      "body": "So im 25 weeks today, and my mom is planning a baby shower for me at the end of june/beginning of july. Its kinda early (im due aug 31st) but i live in florida and my whole family lives in Michigan so id have to fly home and i dont really want to fly too late in my pregnancy. Anyways im going to be using amazon for my registry just because i need all the gifts shipped to my house in florida. Has anyone else ever dealt with a situation like this? Should i make a statement telling people that i need it shipped and not to actually bring anything cause i mean my mom said she would mail stuff that people do end up bringing but it could get expensive depending on gifts i get. Also im a FTM so what are some absolute must haves that you ladies put on your registry??? I basically have nothing and im starting to get stressed out lol so i at least wanna get started on that."

I’m now 4 weeks post procedure  and they don’t look as thick and dark as I’d like. I know I have to wait for the second touch up appointment to fill in the bald spots but I’m getting worried about the final result. If you had them done, do you still need to use make up to make them look fuller?"
